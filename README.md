# Glider speed polars curve analysis

The speed polar curve shows the sink rate of a glider against its airspeed. Polar curves are used to calculate the glider's minimum sink rate, best lift/drag ratio (L/D) and flight speed.

This project provides various notebook to compute/analysis glider polars.
