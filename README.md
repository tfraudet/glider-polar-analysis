# Glider speed polars curve analysis

The speed polar curve shows the sink rate of an glideragainst its airspeed is known as a polar curve. Polar curves are used to compute the glider's minimum sink speed, best lift over drag (L/D), and speed to fly.

This project provides various notebook to compute/analysis glider polars.
